# Movie-Recommender-System
- A movie recommendation system, or a movie recommender system, is an ML-based approach to filtering or predicting the users’ film preferences based on their past choices and behavior. It’s an advanced filtration mechanism that predicts the possible movie choices of the concerned user and their preferences towards a domain-specific item, aka movie.
- To understand movie recommendations in a little depth we need to understand the two broad types of recommendation systems which are: Content Based and Collaborative based recommendation systems.
#
**Content Based Recommendation System** : It uses attributes such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make suggestions for the users. The intuition behind this sort of recommendation system is that if a user liked a particular movie or show, he/she might like a movie or a show similar to it.
# 
**Collaborative Based Recommendation System**: It matches users with same interests and gives recommendations based on their likes. Eg: There are two users Sam and Robin, Sam likes movies A,B,C,D and Robin likes movies C,D. Since movies C,D are common to both Sam and Robin, thus movies A and B would be recommended to Robin. Collaborative filtering does not make use of metadata to give recommendations.
